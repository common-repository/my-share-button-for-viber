INCREASE YOUR WEBSITE TRAFFIC VIA VIBER SHARE BUTTON!

== Description ==

Increase your website traffic by allowing people to share your WordPress posts/links over Viber!
Check out your traffic sources in Google Analytics and you will notice that more and more people are coming from mobile devices (green bar).
Many mobile devices use Viber and this plugin will allow you to have "share on Viber" button in every single post of your website.

Additionally, you have a custom shortcode which you can put ANYWHERE and share any text you want with any url.

To do that you need to use the following shortcode (replace text and url with your own)

[viber_share align=left text="Hey, check out blog platform I am using!" url=http://www.wordpress.org]

<strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong> Premium version of the plugin is in development phase. If you donate now it will be counted as a preorder and you will get premium version for free once it's released.
